1. **MEAN**
   * Mongo DB, Express.js, Angular.js, NODE.js - a well known tech stack. 

2. **Flutter**
   * Dart, the Flutter engine, Foundation Library, and design-specific widgets - open source software development for Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Web, and Linux applications from a single codebase.
  
3. **Ruby on Rails**
   * Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for UI and XML or JSON for data transfer - open-source, object-oriented, and detailed error logging. 

4. **Meteor.js**
   * Uses Javascript that ranges from the applications’ database to the viewer’s screen - open source that allows you to use the same code to develop apps for iOS, Android, desktop, and the web.

5. **MERN**
   * Mongo DB, Express.js, React, NODE.js - similar to MEAN but with React this stack allows you to utilize JavaScript XML and Virtual DOM.
